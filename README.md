# Airbnb Analysis Project
## Overview
The Airbnb Analysis project delves into data exploration and analysis of Airbnb listings, reviews, and user data. By leveraging Python, MongoDB Atlas, Streamlit, and visualization tools, this project aims to uncover insights into pricing dynamics, availability patterns, and location-based trends within the Airbnb ecosystem.

## Objectives
Retrieve and preprocess Airbnb data from MongoDB Atlas.
Develop a Streamlit web application with interactive geospatial visualizations.
Analyze pricing variations across locations, property types, and seasons.
Visualize availability patterns and occupancy rates.
Investigate location-based insights for specific regions or neighborhoods.
Create interactive visualizations and a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau or Power BI.

## Technologies Used
Python: Scripting and data analysis.
MongoDB Atlas: Data storage and retrieval.
Streamlit: Web application development.
Tableau or Power BI: Dashboard creation.

## Learning Outcomes
Participants will enhance their skills in Python scripting, data preprocessing, geospatial visualization, and dashboard creation. Additionally, they will gain proficiency in MongoDB Atlas for data management and Streamlit for web application development. The project emphasizes problem-solving, data-driven decision-making, collaboration, and project management skills.

## Evaluation Metrics
Evaluation criteria include code modularity, maintainability, portability, GitHub maintenance, README quality, adherence to coding standards, and the creation of a demo video for LinkedIn. Participants will be assessed on their ability to create a functional and visually appealing analysis tool that provides valuable insights into Airbnb data.
